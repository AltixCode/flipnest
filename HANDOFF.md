# Flipnest — handoff

What was actually run, and what is still unknown. **Unverified is `UNKNOWN`,
never a pass** — a green build is not a verification.

## What this app is

Flipnest is a daily twelve-pair memory board with four themes. Boards are dealt in pairs then shuffled, so every board is solvable by construction.

Built 2026-09-15 from an empty scaffold: before that the repo held four template
screens and no logic at all, while the tagline, the store record and the paywall
all described a game that did not exist.

## Known UNKNOWNs

- **Nothing here has run on hardware.** The game has never been played. A full
  test suite says the rules are right; it says nothing about whether the app
  launches, whether a tap lands, or whether the screen is legible at arm's
  length. Those rows stay ⬜ until dev-3a runs them.
- Screenshots and the IAP review screenshot both need that same device pass.
